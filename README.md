# Exploratory data Analysis on Breast Cancer


## Project Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on breast cancer data to gain insights into the characteristics of breast cancer cases. The primary goal is to understand the data, identify patterns, and explore potential factors associated with breast cancer.

### Data Description
- It includes features concavity_worst, area_mean,radius_se such as  and more.
- The target variable indicates whether a breast mass is malignant (M) or benign (B).

## Tools and Libraries
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

## Exploratory Data Analysis
### Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values, if any.
- Checked for and removed duplicates.
- Converted Categorical attributes to numerical attributes


### Data Visualization
- Visualized the distribution of diagnostic classes (Malignant vs. Benign).
- Created  scatter plots to explore feature distributions and relationships.
- Used correlation matrices to identify potential correlations between variables.

## Key Findings
- The dataset contains a total of 569 samples, with 212 malignant and 357 benign cases.
-Concave_points_worst was the main feature related to diagnosis.


## Final Steps
- Performed feature selection to identify the most important variables.
- Built predictive models for breast cancer classification using machine learning algorithms.
- Compared various models,and tried improving them with hyperparameter finetuning.
